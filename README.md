Digital Media - Media Signal Processing - Final Project

## Run the piece
This piece has been designed to run on the software Max/Msp, on it's version 7.3.4.
To run the piece you just have to open the project, it will start by itself 
on the "world-main" `jit.gl.world` Max object. 

### For Windows 64bits users
Built in Vbap (Vector Based Amplitude Panning) is missing however [Nathan Wolek adapted it](https://github.com/nwolek/vbap). May his life be filled with happiness.

## Presentation
This piece takes place a spaceship cockpit during 2 minutes and 43 seconds,
while we can follow this exploration from an external point of viex.
2D and 3D effects are mixed to create an athmosphere inspired by video-games.
The sound effects does not include any music to enhance immersion.

## Architecture
This is a Max/Msp project. Each functionality has been separated in a subpatcher.
Main is the root. Names of subpatchers are pretty self explanatory.
JavaScript language has been mainly used to draw 2D effects through object
oriented programming.

## Context
This is the final project in the course media signal processing. 4 persons contributed to this.
